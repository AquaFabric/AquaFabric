# RewovenMC



RewovenMC is a Free and Open Source API for Fabric on Minecraft 1.7.10, 1.8.9, 1.9.4, 1.10.2, 1.11.2, and 1.12.2!



# Why Fabric on old Minecraft?

Fabric is a modern loader, built to be lightweight, efficient, and easy to use. Forge tends to be harder to work with, unstable, and inneficient.

On top of that, Forge on versions older than 1.16 are no longer supported by Forge, we are dedicated to supporting older Minecraft, and giving you everything you need to reweave the game.
