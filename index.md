# AquaFabric

Fabric Intermediaries, Yarn mappings, and API for 1.13.2.
Previous 1.13 Fabric projects have been based on the late Legacy Fabric, but I believe that it'd be more worthwhile to backport modern Fabric to 1.13.2, since 1.13.2 is closer to 1.14 than it is 1.12.2. 1.13 has more in common with modern versions than it does Legacy versions, so I believe that 1.13 should be considered as such.
Therefore, the most practical way to approach this would be to backport the modern Fabric toolchain than to upport Rewoven (Legacy Fabric's successor).

# Why Fabric on 1.13.2?

Why not Fabric on 1.13.2? 
- Forge is slow, buggy, and hard to use. 
- Rift is focken dead, and also not very easy to use. 
There's only upsides here from a technical standpoint.

# How can I help?

You're focken crazy, you know that?
Eh don't sweat it, I'm crazier.
You can start by forking, and submitting PRs.

# What about modern versions that Fabric are dropping?

### We want to support those too! 
We aim to backport updates to the latest Fabric API to older versions of the game that Fabric dropped support for, such as 1.14.4, and 1.15.2.
One thing that must be noted is **We are not The Fabric Project**, that is, we cannot update as regularly as they do. 
However that doesn't mean we can't get the API up to latest. In fact, we can, just not as often.
We intend to update it every few weeks or so, which for an unsupported version, should still be more than adequate.
